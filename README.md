## :scroll: Description

<!--- Describe your app in one or two sentences -->

The aim of COVMAN is to completely replace and automatize all checks that have to be done due to
COVID-19 including;
I. checking for the availability of nose mask on personâ€™s face
II. checking of temperature,
III. provision of sanitizer
IV. marking of attendance in schools and universities
before a person is allowed into a public establishment.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context

Lack of an autonomous system to emphasize the obedience of COVID-19 protocols has brought about
the need for human resources to be used for the monitoring of the said protocols (wearing of nose
mask, using sanitizer, checking temperature and so much more.).
